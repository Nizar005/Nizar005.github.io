				<h1>About Website</h1>
				<p> All of this started when i posted my blender art in instragram. i think "it will be difficult to post only to instagram, because there are only a few ratios to choose from, i might think twice if i want to make a project that has various ratios from" from that i have idea to build a website, pretty good for experience. first i make web in wordpress hosted by <a href="https://profreehost.com/" target="blank">ProFreeHost</a>. even though it's free and have unlimited storage space, the hosting is terrible. several times I can't login to my website. so i moved to <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="blank">Wordpress</a>. but the free version has limitation of storage size. so i decide to learn css html and maybe javascript. besides being able to make the website more flexible, it looks cool on common people.</p>
